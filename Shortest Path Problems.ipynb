    "### PROBLEM 2.\n",
    "Consider the Time-Dependent Shortest Path Problem. In the lecture notes, we assume\n",
    "that for all τ1 < τ2, then τ1 + cuv(τ1) < τ2 + cuv(τ2).<br><br>\n",
    "**a) Explain what this assumption means in simple language, and why it makes sense to assume it.**<br>\n",
    "This means that we cannot arrive at a destination sooner by simply waiting until a later time to leave.  This is a natural and sound assumption because although the travel time may be shorter later, we can never do better than the person who is already on the road (but it may be preferable to watch tv and let traffic die down!)<br><br>\n",
    "**b) Explain where Dijkstra’s Algorithm could fail if we do not have this assumption.**<br>\n",
    "If this assumption did not apply, then Dijkstra's algorithm would fail by greedily adding a Node to the \"Explored\" set too early.  There is a similar consequence for the \"no negative costs\" assumption.<br><br>\n",
    "### PROBLEM 3.\n",
    "Consider the standard Shortest Path Problem.**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) After we have solved the shortest path problem, we would now like to find the second shortest path (which may have the same cost). Provide a method to do this.**\n",
    "Unfortunately this is a hard problem.  One slow way to do this would be to list all possible paths with an optimized algorithm.  Then start calculating costs for each path, and sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A faster method would be to first compute the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.  With this saved path (P) of E edges, we will iterate through each edge, making the cost infinity one by one.  We compute the shortest path E times and select the lowest.  This method allows for a path to use all but one of the original shortest path's edges (with a short detour), but will not allow a path to contain all of P.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b) Your relative insists that a certain edge must be used on the shortest path. Provide a method that finds the shortest path that includes that edge.**\n",
    "For this particular problem we can put a very negative cost on the required edge to incentivize using it.  However, now, we cannot use Dijkstra's Algorithm because a key assumption for it is non-negative costs (due to the greedy way in which it adds nodes to the \"explored set\"). Instead, we can use Bellman Ford's algorithm which has a longer runtime, but iteratively updates costs if a path is possible and shorter (i.e. if this negative path is found near the end of the graph). One key assumption we would need here is an **Acyclic** graph. \n"
